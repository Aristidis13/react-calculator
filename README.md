# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

##Description
This is a side project I made to learn the basics of react and redux and practice in Modular Programming.
There only 3 Components-Modules:
 - A Screen Section
 - Buttons that are trully buttons for HTML Semantics (without a form element)
 - A Calculator Component that contains a Screen and Buttons

For the redux store there are only 4 fields: 2 numbers fields, the text that will appear in screen and the operator.

All in all a very simple app with no incredible details that were created just for learning and fun.

You can visit the calculator [here](https://aristidis13.github.io/react-calculator/)
