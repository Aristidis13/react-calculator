# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description
A SPA I built with React and Redux with an exclusive focus on practicing. I used the create-react-app as a setup since it is a SPA. The app can compute a plethora of operations and return the result on the screen. The app is modular because I wanted to experiment with modular JS programming. Also, the redux seemed unnecessary because it's a small app, but it was a more intriguing way to code. In conclusion, a responsive web app focused on Frontend Components with the sole purpose of experimenting.

This is a project I made to learn the basic syntax of modern react and redux and practice in Modular Programming.
There only 3 Components-Modules:
 - A Screen Section
 - Buttons that are trully buttons for HTML Semantics (without a form element)
 - A Calculator Component that contains a Screen and Buttons

For the redux store there are only 4 fields: 2 numbers fields, the text that will appear in screen and the operator.

All in all a very simple app with no incredible details that were created just for learning and fun.
